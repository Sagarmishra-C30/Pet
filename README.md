# Pet - Your Cute Little Pet

Pet is an event-driven program written in Python using the tkinter. It creates a graphical representation of a cute little pet that responds to various user interactions and timers. The pet's behavior and appearance change based on events such as mouse movements, mouse clicks, and timeouts.

## Features

The current version of Pet.py includes the following features:

1. **Blinking**: The pet blinks at regular intervals, adding a realistic touch to its behavior.
2. **Winking**: Double-clicking on the pet makes it wink one eye and stick out its tongue briefly.
3. **Happiness**: When the mouse cursor moves over the pet's face, it becomes happy, displaying happy cheeks and a smiling mouth.
4. **Sadness**: If the pet is *ignored for 50 seconds*, it becomes sad, displaying a frowning mouth.
5. **Tongue Out**: The pet can stick out its tongue when certain interactions occur.
6. **Pupil Movement**: The pet's pupils can cross to the center when it becomes cheeky.
7. **Color Change**: The pet's color changes *every 5 seconds*, randomly selecting from a set of predefined colors.
8. **Customization**: The pet's body color, ears, and feet can be customized to different colors.
9. **Graphics**: The pet is visually represented using graphical shapes, lines, and colors.

## Planned Improvements and Additional Features

The current version of Pet is a basic implementation, and there are several possible improvements and additional features that can be considered:

1. **Sound Effects**: Adding sound effects to various interactions can enhance the user experience.
2. **Animations**: Implementing animated movements, such as tail wagging or dancing, can make the pet more engaging.
3. **Speech**: Allowing the pet to communicate through text or recorded voice lines can add a more interactive element.
4. **Expanded Interactions**: Adding more interactive features, like feeding the pet or playing mini-games, can increase engagement.
5. **Pet Customization**: Providing options for users to customize the pet's appearance, including colors, patterns, and accessories.
6. **Pet Levels and Progression**: Introducing a leveling system where the pet gains experience or happiness points, unlocking new behaviors or visuals.
7. **Save and Load Functionality**: Enabling users to save and load the pet's state, including level, appearance, and preferences.
8. **Pet Intelligence**: Implementing basic AI capabilities to allow the pet to learn and respond intelligently to user interactions.
9. **Multiplayer Mode**: Creating a multiplayer feature where multiple users can interact with each other's pets simultaneously.
10. **Mobile App Version**: Developing a mobile app version of Pet.py for users to interact with the pet on their smartphones or tablets.
